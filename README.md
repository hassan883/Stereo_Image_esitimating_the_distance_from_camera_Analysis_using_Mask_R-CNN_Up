## Introduction

The code in this repository is designed to facilitate the analysis of stereo images by identifying and segmenting objects within the images. By utilizing a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model, the code can detect objects, classify them, and provide segmentation masks that outline the objects within the images.

## Features

- Load and preprocess stereo images.
- Perform object detection using Mask R-CNN.
- Draw bounding boxes and segmentation masks on images.
- Utility functions for image processing and analysis.
